`wordle_rs`
-----------

Have you ever gotten so obsessed with [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) that you wanted to evaluate different strategies programmatically? If so, you're in the right place.

`wordle_rs` has two parts: `wordle_perf`, a crate with tools you can use to write and evaluate your own Wordle strategies, and `wordle_strategies`, a crate demonstrating few strategies that I wrote.
Please feel free to contribute strategies to `wordle_strategies`!
